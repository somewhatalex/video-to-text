# video-to-text
This converts most formats of video files into an ascii animation via the standard command prompt.

Simply edit the configs to your preference and it'll spit something out. Note that it'll be rendered in slowmode (unless you have a really good computer and set the render speed to a very low amount), so you'll have to record it and speed it up with editing.

Here's an example (this was the first version of the script so it's really buggy, but the current one works a lot better):

Let me know of any bugs. This script requires that you have node.js, [image-to-ascii](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/image-to-ascii), and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed. Follow the download instructions to set them up.

I highly suggest you save it in its own folder. This probably will work in other OS' command prompts but I've only tested it on Windows.
